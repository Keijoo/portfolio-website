    <h2>About VR & AR</h2>
    <p>Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated simulation that immerses users in a fully virtual environment, while Augmented Reality (AR) overlays digital content in the real world. Both technologies are enhancing human experiences in remarkable ways.</p>
    <p>From the early days of VR in the 1960s to today’s immersive gaming experiences, both VR and AR have come a long way. These technologies are now revolutionizing industries like healthcare, where surgeons practice with AR-assisted models, and retail, where customers can try virtual products before making a purchase.</p>

<h3>How much does a VR headset cost?</h3>
    <p>The price of a VR headset can vary widely depending on the brand, features, and the platform it's compatible with. Here’s a rough breakdown:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Entry-Level VR Headsets</strong>: These typically cost between <strong> €100 and €300</strong>. These headsets may rely on smartphones or computers for processing power. Examples include: <a id="link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/blog/oculus-go-available-now-our-best-vr-optics-in-our-first-standalone-vr-headset/?srsltid=AfmBOorP6hY4VvgC1hJ97XawMIOmIGnvf7X051BuAk2TgHUVlh2VjG5y">Oculus Go</a> and <a id="link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/mobile/virtual-reality/gear-vr/gear-vr-with-controller/">Samsung Gear VR</a>.</li>

      <li><strong>Mid-Range VR Headsets</strong>: Ranging from <strong> €300 to €600</strong>, these headsets offer better resolution, tracking, and a more immersive experience. Examples include: <a id="link"  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_2"> Quest 2</a> and <a id="link"  href="https://www.playstation.com/en-fi/ps-vr/">PlayStation VR.</a></li>
      <li><strong>High-End VR Headsets</strong>: Prices for top-tier headsets can go from <strong> €600 to over €1,000</strong>. These headsets require a powerful PC or gaming console to work. Examples include: <a id="link"  href="https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex"> Valve Index </a> and <a  id="link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/quest/459034058728993/?srsltid=AfmBOoryYSEct0tD3GwDn4viZtlKGZuJU1Pq915EKolwQQsKCYJ8AEg0"> Oculus Rift S. </a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note: The prices often fluctuate based on sales, promotions, or new product releases.</p>

<h3>What are the best VR games?</h3>
  <p>The world of VR gaming is vast, with games spanning various genres. Here are some of the best VR games across different categories:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Action/Adventure</strong>: Half-Life: Alyx, The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners</li>
    <li><strong>Sports/Exercise</strong>: Beat Saber, Superhot VR</li>
    <li><strong>Exploration</strong>: No Man's Sky VR, Star Trek: Bridge Crew</li>
    <li><strong>Simulation</strong>: VRChat, The Climb</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note: Some games are exclusive to certain platforms, so check compatibility before purchasing.</p>

<h3>How does AR work on mobile devices?</h3>
  <p>Augmented Reality (AR) on mobile devices works by overlaying digital information (such as images, videos, or 3D objects) on top of the real world. Here's a breakdown:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera and Sensors</strong>: Mobile devices use their built-in cameras to capture the physical environment around the user. In addition, devices have gyroscopes, accelerometers, and GPS to understand the device’s orientation, movement, and location.</li>
    <li><strong>Software and Processing</strong>: The device uses software like ARKit (iOS) or ARCore (Android) to process real-world data and accurately place virtual objects.</li>
    <li><strong>Rendering and Display</strong>: After processing, the device overlays the digital content on the camera feed, giving the illusion that virtual objects are interacting with the real world.</li>
    <li><strong>Interaction</strong>: Users can interact with these objects via touch controls, gestures, or device movement.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Example of AR apps include Pokémon GO, IKEA Place, and Google Lens.</p>
